            Community economic development (CED) is a holistic strategy that
            seeks to enhance local economies and enhance the welfare of
            communities. Initiatives and plans are guided by a community's
            social, environmental, and economic concerns. It highlights the
            active engagement and participation of community members in creating
            the economic development efforts and decisions that impact their
            lives. CED encompasses more than just the attraction of external
            capital. It involves the cultivation of local entrepreneurship, the
            encouragement of innovation, and the advancement of fair economic
            development that benefits all individuals.

          Understanding the needs of the most vulnerable, ANHF has been actively
          involved in social support initiatives. During the holy month of
          Ramadan, we organize Iftar programs to feed needy Muslims, ensuring
          they can break their fasts with dignity. Our foundation also extends
          its support to the less fortunate by regularly visiting and providing
          aid to Mji wa Salama and Mkomani Childrenâ€™s Home. These efforts are
          part of our broader commitment to uplifting the lives of orphans,
          vulnerable children, and families in need.
