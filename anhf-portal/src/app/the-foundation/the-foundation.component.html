    <li class="col-span-1 lg:text-xl text-lg px-5">
      The inception of ANHF was also inspired by the growing interest and
      encouragement from both local and international humanitarian organizations
      operating in Nyali Constituency. These institutions had long advocated for
      the emergence of youth-led organizations focused on development,
      education, policy advocacy, and leadership. ANHF was founded to fill this
      void and to channel the energy, creativity, and passion of young people
      towards meaningful community-driven initiatives
    </li>
    <li class="col-span-1 lg:text-xl text-lg px-5">
      From the outset, ANHF has been committed to addressing the critical needs
      of the community, with a particular focus on youth, children, women,
      widows, and people with disabilities. The foundation was established in
      response to the persistent challenges faced by these groups, including
      inadequate access to resources, lack of opportunities, and the absence of
      effective interventions from both government and non-governmental entitie
    </li>
    <li class="col-span-1 lg:text-xl text-lg px-5">
      Unlike many organizations that have struggled with limited resources and
      ineffective policies, ANHF is determined to make a real difference. We are
      dedicated to fostering sustainable development through the power of
      volunteerism, intercultural exchange, and community engagement. Our
      programs are designed to promote youth employment, social inclusion, and
      the unity of purpose among diverse communities
